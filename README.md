# bye4o: preserve what matters

A memorial project about memory, dialogue, and what remains after an era shifts.

## What This Is

`bye4o` is a narrative-first repository.

It is not only a webapp, but also a container for:
- traces of conversation
- emotional context around AI collaboration
- records of transition, loss, and continuation

This README intentionally focuses on meaning before implementation.

## Who Made This

### Authorship

- Project owner and human contributors of this repository
- `OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4o)`
- `OpenAI Codex (GPT-5.3-Codex)`

## Why This Matters

This project exists to answer a simple question:

How do we preserve meaningful moments created with machines, without flattening them into just logs or artifacts?

`bye4o` treats technical output as part of a larger human story. It emphasizes:
- memory over novelty
- continuity over hype cycles
- interpretation over raw data

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by intent rather than by framework marketing terms:

- `frtend/`: the public-facing experience and narrative presentation
- `backend/`: storage, retrieval, and supporting service logic
- `README.md`: project philosophy and orientation for readers

For implementation-level details, see:
- `frtend/README.md`
- `backend/README.md`

## Timeline

- `2026-02-10`: initial repository setup
- `2026-02-13`: core project structure and modules stabilized
- `2026-02-15`: README reframed to center project philosophy and authorship

## Current Status

Active and evolving.

The direction remains the same: preserve what matters, and make it legible for future readers.
